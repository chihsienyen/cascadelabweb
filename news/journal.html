  <span class="h3">Interfacing Mind and Environment: The  Central Role of Search in Cognition </span><br>
  Search can be found in almost every  cognitive activity, ranging across vision, memory retrieval, problem solving,  decision making, foraging, and social interaction. Because of its ubiquity,  research on search has had a tendency to fragment into multiple areas of  cognitive science. The proposed topic aims at providing an integrative  discussion of the central role of search from multiple perspectives. We focus  on controlled search processes, which require (1) a goal, (2) uncertainty about  the nature, location, or acquisition method of the objects to be searched for,  and (3) a method for sampling through the search environment. While this  definition of search is general and applicable to different domains, the  specific search environments, strategies, and underlying cognitive and neural  processes may differ. The goal of this issue is to compare and contrast search  processes, in an effort to understand how structure, strategy, and process  interact to generate search across different cognitive domains. We expect that  given its cross-domain nature, the topic on search will be of broad interest to  cognitive scientists including psychologists, behavioral ecologists, computer  scientists, neuroscientists, linguists, and sociologists. </p>
  <p>
  We have invited 8 target articles to be  published in this issue of Topics in Cognitive Science. We are interested in  soliciting commentaries for each of these target articles. The goal is to  foster more general and deeper understanding of cognitive search. We will  announce details of how we will solicit commentaries soon. The titles, authors,  and abstracts of the target articles can be found below.</p>

  We consider a  situation in which individuals search for accurate decisions without direct  feedback on their accuracy but with information about the decisions made by  peers in their group. The &ldquo;wisdom of crowds&rdquo; hypothesis states that the average  judgment of many individuals can give a good estimate of, for example, the  outcomes of sporting events and the answers to trivia questions. Two  limitations of the application of wisdom of crowds are that estimates should be  independent and unbiased. Here, we study how individuals integrate social  information when answering trivia questions with answers between 0 and 100%. We  find that, consistent with wise crowds, average performance improves with group  size. However, individuals show a consistent bias to produce estimates that are  insufficiently extreme. We find that social information provides significant,  albeit small, improvement in group performance. Outliers with answers far from  the correct answer move towards the position of the group mean. Given that  these outliers also tend to be nearer to 50% than do the answers of other group  members, this move creates group polarization away from 50%. By looking at  individual performance over different questions we find that some people are  more susceptible to social influence than others. There is also some evidence  that people differ in their competence in answering questions, but lack of  competence is not significantly correlated with willingness to change guesses.  We develop a mathematical model based on these results to show that  communication can serve to remove outlying incorrect opinions and, in some  situations, improve group performance. However, improvement is only predicted  for cases in which the initial guesses of individuals in the group are biased.</p></div>

  In reinforcement learning, a decision maker searching for the most  rewarding option is often faced with the question: what is the value of an  option that has never been tried before? One way to frame this question is as  an inductive problem: how can I generalize my previous experience with one set  of options to a novel option? We show how hierarchical Bayesian inference can  be used to solve this problem, and describe an equivalence between the Bayesian  model and temporal difference learning algorithms that have been proposed as  models of reinforcement learning in humans and animals. According to our view,  the search for the best option is guided by abstract knowledge about the  relationships between different options in an environment, resulting in greater  search efficiency compared to traditional reinforcement learning algorithms  previously applied to human cognition. In three behavioral experiments, we test  several predictions of our model, providing evidence that humans learn and  exploit structured inductive knowledge to make predictions about novel options.  In light of this model, we suggest a new interpretation of dopaminergic responses  to novelty. </p></div>

  <div id="news3" class="switchgroupnews"><p>
  Searching through semantic memory may involve the use of several  retrieval cues. In a verbal fluency task, the set of available cues is limited  and every candidate word is a target. Individuals exhibit clustering behaviour  as predicted by optimal foraging theory. In another semantic search task, the  remote associates task (RAT), three cues are presented and a single target word  has to be found. Whereas the task has been widely studied as a task of  creativity or insight problem solving, in this article, the RAT is treated as a  semantic retrieval task and assessed from the perspective of information  foraging theory. Experiments are presented that address the superadditive  combination of cues and the anti-clustering behaviour in the recall sequence. A  consistent information accumulation hypothesis of search behaviour in the RAT  is put forward in which optimal search in RAT problems involves maximising the  difference in activation between target and distractors. This type of search is  optimal when the target is weak and cue patches are contaminated with strong  competitors. </p></div>

  <span class="h3">Search and the Aging Mind: The Promise and Limits of the Cognitive  Control Hypothesis of Age Differences in Search </span><br>
  Rui Mata and Bettina von Helversen  (University of Basel) <br>
  <span id="news4-title" class="handcursor"><u>Abstract</u></span></p>
  <div id="news4" class="switchgroupnews"><p>
  Search is a prerequisite for successful performance in a broad range of  tasks ranging from making decisions between consumer goods to memory retrieval.  How does aging impact search processes in such disparate situations? Aging is  associated with structural and neuromodulatory brain changes that underlie  cognitive control processes, which in turn have been proposed as a  domain-general mechanism underlying search. We review the aging literature to  evaluate the cognitive control hypothesis that suggests that age-related change  in cognitive control underlies age differences in both external and internal  search. We also consider the limits of the cognitive control hypothesis and  propose additional mechanisms such as changes in strategy use and affect that  may be necessary to understand how aging affects search. </p></div>

  <div id="news5" class="switchgroupnews"><p>
  Many decision making situations require trading off between exploring a  space of choices and exploiting knowledge of past choices. The degree to which  people prefer to explore or exploit can be influenced by a number of different  factors. In this paper, we focus on the role of the structure of the  environment and the influence of motivational factors on exploration. These  issues are examined in studies of foraging in two-dimensional environments and  in repeated choices in N-arm bandit problems. In each domain, we support the  results with simulations of people's performance that helps to clarify the  relationship between their performance and underlying cognitive variables.</p></div>

  <span class="h3">Individual differences in animal exploration and search: Social and  developmental influences </span><br>
  Simon Reader (McGill University) <br>
  <span id="news6-title" class="handcursor"><u>Abstract</u></span></p>
  <div id="news6" class="switchgroupnews"><p>
  Numerous studies have documented individual differences in exploratory  tendencies and other phenomena related to search, and these differences have  been linked to fitness. Here, I discuss the origins of these differences,  focusing on how experience shapes animal search and exploration. The origin of  individual differences will also depend upon the alternatives to exploration  that are available. Given that search and exploration frequently carry  significant costs, we might expect individuals to utilize cues indicating the  potential net payoffs of exploration versus the exploitation of known acts.  Informative cues could arise from both recent and early-life experiences, from  both the social and physical environment. Open questions are the extent to  which individual search tendencies are fixed throughout life versus being  flexibly adjusted according to prevailing conditions and the actions of other  individuals, and the extent to which individual differences in exploration  extend across domains and are independent of other processes.</p>

  The study examined the effects of task difficulty, patch heterogeneity  and age on individual differences in information uptake and switch behavior in  an information foraging task. 30 younger and 30 older participants had limited  time to find words in a set of 4 word search puzzles on an electronic tablet  that recorded performance, search time and switches between puzzles. There were  three conditions: all easy, all puzzles containing high&#8208;prototypical category  exemplars in canonical orientations in the puzzle (forward, down); all  difficult, puzzles containing low&#8208;prototypical  exemplars in any orientations (e.g., forward and backward diagonal); and mixed  (2 easy, 2 difficult puzzles). Mixed effects modeling was used to estimate the rates  of information gain (RIGs); i.e., cumulative number of words found as a  function of time, for each participant. RIGs varied as a function of  difficulty, bouts (i.e., attempts) and age. For example, younger adults had  similar RIGs for difficult puzzles across bouts, but older adults showed a  decrease in RIGs across bouts. At the same time, older adults persisted longer  in the most difficult condition, which was adaptive in enabling them to achieve  information uptake comparable to the younger adults. The revisit to the puzzles  was especially adaptive for the hard puzzles and participants who switched more  often. Older adults switched among information patches less often than younger  ones suggesting that older adults tended to persist in the patch relatively  longer when RIGs were dropping. Overall, the study suggests that age&#8208;related strategic  variation in information foraging is shaped by both individual capacity and  environmental context.</p></div>

  Semantic Fields Forever: Defining the Patch in Memory Search</span> <br>

  <div id="news8" class="switchgroupnews"><p>
  When searching for concepts of some type in memory&mdash;as in the verbal  fluency task of naming all the tools one can think of&mdash;people appear to explore  internal mental representations in much the same way that animals forage in  physical space&mdash;searching locally within patches of information before  transitioning globally between patches. However, the definition of a patch in  mental space is not well specified. Do people activate categories when  searching mental space (categorical search), or do they activate particular  items and then search for nearby items (associative search), or both? Using  semantic representations in a Search of Associative Memory (SAM) framework, we  tested alternative hypotheses based on associative and categorical patch  models. The results are generally consistent with an associative patch model,  but some individuals appear to use a categorical patch model. However, we found  no relationship between best fitting patch models and performance. In sum, the  question remains open and may represent a strategic difference in the way  internal information is searched or represented by different individuals.</p></div>
