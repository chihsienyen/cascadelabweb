<p>Liao, Q., &amp; Fu. W.-T. (2013). Beyond the filter bubble:   Interactive effects of perceived threat and topic involvement on   selective exposure to information. In Proceedings of the ACM SIGCHI   conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI), Paris, France. [<a href="../downloads/p2359-liao.pdf" target="_blank">PDF</a>] [<span id="fu46-title" class="handcursor"><u>Abstract</u></span>]
<div id="fu46" class="switchgroup3"><p>We investigated participants' preferential selection of
information and their attitude moderation in an online
environment. Results showed that even when opposing
views were presented side-to-side, people would still
preferentially select information that reinforced their
existing attitudes. Preferential selection of information was,
however, influenced by both situational (e.g., perceived
threat) and personal (e.g., topic involvement) factors.
Specifically, perceived threat induced selective exposure to
attitude consistent information for topics that participants
had low involvement. Participants had a higher tendency to
select peer user opinions in topics that they had low than
high involvement, but only when there was no perception of
threat. Overall, participants’ attitudes were moderated after
being exposed to diverse views, although high topic
involvement led to higher resistance to such moderation.
Perceived threat also weakened attitude moderation,
especially for low involvement topics. Results have
important implication to the potential effects of
"information bubble" – selective exposure can be induced
by situational and personal factors even when competing
views are presented side-by-side.

In Proceedings of the ACM SIGCHI conference on   Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI), Paris, France. [<a href="../downloads/sHuangwFu CHI.pdf" target="_blank">PDF</a>]
[<span id="fu99-title" class="handcursor"><u>Abstract</u></span>]
<div id="fu99" class="switchgroup3"><p>This paper studied how social transparency and different
peer-dependent reward schemes (i.e., individual, teamwork,
and competition) affect the outcomes of crowdsourcing. The
results showed that when social transparency was increased
by asking otherwise anonymous workers to share their demographic
information (e.g., name, nationality) to the paired
worker, they performed significantly better. A more detailed
analysis showed that in a teamwork reward scheme, in which
the reward of the paired workers depended only on the collective
outcomes, increasing social transparency could offset
effects of social loafing by making them more accountable
to their teammates. In a competition reward scheme, in
which workers competed against each other and the reward
depended on how much they outperformed their opponent,
increasing social transparency could augment effects of social
facilitation by providing more incentives for them to outperform
their opponent. The results suggested that a careful
combination of methods that increase social transparency and
different reward schemes can significantly improve crowdsourcing
outcomes.

In   Proceedings of the International Conference on Intelligent User   Interfaces (IUI), Santa Monica, CA. [<a href="../downloads/Huang13-IUI.pdf" target="_blank">PDF</a>] [<span id="fu38-title" class="handcursor"><u>Abstract</u></span>]
<div id="fu38" class="switchgroup3"><p>Crowdsourcing and machine learning are both useful techniques
for solving difficult problems (e.g., computer vision
and natural language processing). In this paper, we propose
a novel method that harnesses and combines the strength of
these two techniques to better analyze the features and the
sentiments toward them in user reviews. To strike a good
balance between reducing information overload and providing
the original context expressed by review writers, the proposed
system (1) allows users to interactively rank the entities
based on feature-rating, (2) automatically highlights sentences
that are related to relevant features, and (3) utilizes implicit
crowdsourcing by encouraging users to provide correct
labels of their own reviews to improve the feature-sentiment
classifier. The proposed system not only helps users to save
time and effort to digest the often massive amount of user reviews,
but also provides real-time suggestions on relevant features
and ratings as users generate their own reviews. Results
from a simulation experiment show that leveraging on the
crowd can significantly improve the feature-sentiment analysis
of user reviews. Furthermore, results from a user study
show that the proposed interface was preferred by more participants
than interfaces that use traditional noun-adjective
pairs summarization, as the current interface allows users to
view feature-related information in the original context.

In Proceedings of the 16th   ACM conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW), San   Antonio, TX.[<a href="../downloads/sHuangwFu.pdf" target="_blank">PDF</a>] [<span id="fu50-title" class="handcursor"><u>Abstract</u></span>]
<div id="fu50" class="switchgroup3"><p>Peer consistency evaluation is often used in games with a
purpose (GWAP) to evaluate workers using outputs of other
workers without using gold standard answers. Despite its
popularity, the reliability of peer consistency evaluation has
never been systematically tested to show how it can be used
as a general evaluation method in human computation systems.
We present experimental results that show that human
computation systems using peer consistency evaluation can
lead to outcomes that are even better than those that evaluate
workers using gold standard answers. We also show that
even without evaluation, simply telling the workers that their
answers will be used as future evaluation standards can significantly
enhance the workers’ performance. Results have
important implication for methods that improve the reliability
of human computation systems.

<div id="fu49" class="switchgroup3"><p>We report results from a human computation study that
tests the extent to which output agreement games are
better than traditional methods in terms of increasing
quality of labels and motivation of voluntary workers on
a task with a gold standard. We built an output agreement
game that let workers recruited from Amazon’s
Mechanical Turks label the semantic textual similarity
of 20 sentence pairs. To compare and test the effects
of the major components of the game, we created interfaces
that had different combinations of a gaming
environment (G), social interaction (S), and feedback
(F). Our results show that the main reason that an output
agreement game can collect more high-quality labels
is the gaming environment (scoring system, leaderboard,
etc). On the other hand, a worker is much more
motivated to voluntarily do the task if he or she can
do it with another worker (i.e., with social interaction).
Our analysis provides human computation researchers
important insight on understanding how and why the
method of Game with a Purpose (GWAP) can generate
high-quality outcomes and motivate more voluntary
workers.

<div id="fu31" class="switchgroup3"><p>We compared the effects of three computer mediated
communication (CMC) channels (text, audio, and video) on
how people performed an appointment-scheduling task. The
task involved a grounding and a conflict resolution
component. The results showed that video conferencing
supported participant dyads in reaching a consensus that
had better balanced performance between the dyads only
when task difficulty was high and when there were more
inherent conflicts in the task. Participants across the three
CMC conditions also demonstrated different patterns of
conversation dynamics during information exchange and
negotiation. Mediation analysis showed that in video-based
communication, strategies of exchanging less information
at a time predicted higher levels of negotiation, which in
turn predicted smaller performance differences in high
conflict conditions. The results suggested that the design
and use of communication technologies for remote conflict
resolution should promote the strategy of exchanging
information in small pieces, which could better support
subsequent negotiation and foster a sense of fairness.

<div id="fu41" class="switchgroup3"><p>To better support older adults’ consumption of high quality health information on the Internet, it is important to understand how older adults make credibility judgments with online health information. For this purpose, we conducted two laboratory studies to explore how the credibility cues in message contents, website features, and user reviews could differentially impact younger and older adults’ credibility judgments. Results from the first experiment showed that older adults, compared to younger ones, were less sensitive to the credibility cues in message contents, as well as those in the website features. Results from the second experiment showed that user reviews that were consistent with the credibility cues in message contents could reinforce older adults’ credibility judgments. Older adults, compared to younger adults, seemed to be less swayed by user reviews that were inconsistent with the message contents. These results provided implications for designing health information websites that better support older adults’ credibility judgments.

<div id="fu2" class="switchgroup3"><p>
An empirical study was conducted to investigate how older
and younger users learned by performing exploratory
search of health information using an interface that
recommended relevant links based on browsing histories.
While older and younger users gained both factual and
structural knowledge about the health topics, significant age
differences were observed. Our results showed that
processing of recommended and regular Web links imposed
distinct demands on cognitive abilities, which at least
partially explained the observed age differences in the
search process. The use of recommended links was
positively associated with general knowledge, while the use
of regular Web links was positively associated with
processing capacity. Results also showed that the
recommended links benefited both younger and older adults
by broadening the exploration of information, which led to
better learning. Implications on designs of health
information interfaces that facilitate exploratory search and
learning for different age groups were discussed.

<div id="fu40" class="switchgroup3"><p>Judging topical expertise of micro-blogger is one of the key challenges for information seekers when deciding which information sources to follow. However, it is unclear how useful different types of information are for people to make expertise judgments and to what extent their background knowledge influences their judgments. This study explored differences between experts and novices in inferring expertise of Twitter users. In three conditions, participants rated the level of expertise of users after seeing (1) only the tweets, (2) only the contextual information including short biographical and user list information, and (3) both tweets and contextual information. Results indicated that, in general, contextual information provides more useful information for making expertise judgment of Twitter users than tweets. While the addition of tweets seems to make little difference, or even add nuances to novices’ expertise judgment, experts’ judgments were improved when both content and contextual information were presented.

<div id="fu30" class="switchgroup3"><p>We report results of a study which examines consensus
building in user interface design discussions in open source
software communities. Our methodology consisted of
conducting interviews with designers and developers from
the Drupal and Ubuntu communities (N=17) and analyzing
a large corpus of interaction data collected from Drupal.
The interviews captured user perspectives on the challenges
of reaching consensus, techniques employed for building
consensus, and the consequences of not reaching consensus.
We analyzed the interaction data to determine how different
elements of the content, process, and user relationships in
the design discussions affect consensus. The main result
from this analysis shows that design discussions having
participants with more experience and prior interaction are
more likely to reach consensus. Based on all of our results,
we formulated design implications for promoting consensus
in distributed discussions of user interface design issues.

<div id="fu37" class="switchgroup3"><p>We reported a computational model of complex skill learning
that captures the differential effects of Fixed Priority (FP) and
Varied Priority (VP) training on complex skill learning. The
model is developed based on learning mechanisms associated
with the modular circuits linking Basal Ganglia, the prefrontal
association cortex, and the pre-motor cortex during skill
learning. Two forms of learning occur simultaneously. In
discrimination learning, goal-directed actions are selected
through recognition of external stimuli through the
connections between the frontal cortex and the striatum, and
is mediated by dopaminergic signals through a reinforcement
learning mechanism. With practice, skill learning shifts from
discrimination learning to Hebbian learning, which directly
associates stimuli to responses by strengthening the
connection between the prefrontal and pre-motor cortex. The
model shows that FP training, in which all task components
are equally weighted during training, leads to less flexible
discrimination learning than VP training. The model explains
why VP training benefits lower performance participants
more, and why learning was more strongly correlated with the
size of the striatum in VP than FP training.

<div id="fu33" class="switchgroup3"><p>We compared the effects of text-, audio- and video-based
communication methods on how people performed an
appointment-scheduling task that involved both a cooperative
and a conflict resolution component. The results showed that
video-based communication method was more supportive of
cooperative tasks when the task difficulty was high, and when
there were more inherent conflicts in the task, in which more
negotiation was required to resolve the conflicts. As a result,
performance difference of the dyad was smaller in video
communication. Different patterns of conversation dynamics
and problem space visitations further supported the effect of
communication methods. Results of this study have important
implications in understanding the process of collaborative
problem solving and conflict resolution when different
communication channels were used for remote collaborators.

<div id="fu28" class="switchgroup3"><p>We present results from an experiment studying how people
mentally integrated partial configurations of objects shown
across a sequence of displays with varying matches between
frames of reference. Consistent with previous research on
spatial updating, performance was better when the frame of
reference in the final display aligned with the main display
axes (up/down, left/right) than when it aligned with the
diagonal axes. However, we also found that spatial updating
was more efficient when the sequence of presentation of
objects was consistent with the final frame of reference from
which objects were integrated. Results suggested that spatial
updating depended on the sequence of spatial operations
required to integrate new spatial information into existing
ones. Implications to theories of spatial updating in reasoning
tasks are discussed.</p>

<div id="fu29" class="switchgroup3"><p>The study used the word search puzzle paradigm to
investigate the cognitive foraging behavior among younger
and older adults. Older adults had equivalent search
performance with younger adults regardless of their decline in
processing speed. Older adults tended to switch fewer times
and persist longer in the patch than younger adults. Results
further showed that switch behavior was based on the
individual reflection of information uptake, which long
exploitation in the patch of older adults could not be
explained solely by general slowing but their higher tolerance
of the decreasing marginal rate of gain. Overall, older adults
expected to reach higher gains than younger adults before
leaving the current patch. The age-dependent adaptive
foraging behavior was also discussed.

<div id="fu35" class="switchgroup3"><p>We extend previous cascade models of social influence to investigate
how the exchange of quality information among users may moderate cascade
behavior, and the extent to which it may influence the effectiveness of collective
user recommendations on quality control of information. We found that
while cascades do sometimes occur, their effects depend critically on the accuracies
of individual quality assessments of information contents. Contrary to
predictions of cascade models of information flow, quality-based cascades tend
to reinforce the propagation of individual quality assessments rather than being
the primary sources that drive the assessments. We found even small increase in
individual accuracies will significantly improve the overall effectiveness of
crowdsourcing quality control. Implication to domains such as online health
information Web sites or product reviews are discussed.

<div id="fu43" class="switchgroup3"><p>
A laboratory study was conducted to study whether the presence of online user reviews, specifically its interaction with the credibility of information on the Website, has differential impact on younger and older adults' attitude towards medication information on the Internet. Results showed that while there was age difference in how message contents and website features influenced credibility judgments, the presence of user reviews moderated the age difference. Specifically we found: 1) when credibility cues in user reviews were consistent with the credibility cues in Web page contents, older adults’ attitude towards the medication was reinforced more than younger adults, and 2) when the credibility cues in user reviews were inconsistent with the credibility cues in Web page contents, older adults were less sensitive to the influence of user reviews. Especially when highly positive user reviews were given to a seemingly non-credible medication, older adults were less likely to be swayed by user reviews. Possible causes of this age difference in the effects of user reviews were discussed. Results have important implications for the dual-process model of information processing and age differences in attitude change in the context of Internet.

We developed user models of knowledge exploration in a social tagging system to test the expertise rankings generated by a link-structure method and a semantic-structure method. The link-structure method assumed a referential definition of expertise, in which experts were users who tagged resources that were frequently tagged by other experts; the semantic-structure method assumed a representational definition of expertise, in which experts were users who had better knowledge of a particular domain and were better at assigning distinctive tags associated with certain domain-specific resources. Simulations results showed that the two methods of expert identification, although based on different assumptions, were in general consistent but did show significant differences. As expected, the link-structure method was better at facilitating exploration of popular "hot" topics than the semantic-structure method. However, the semantic-structure method was better at guiding users to find less popular “cold” topics than the link-structure method. Resources tagged by domain experts could contain cold topics that were associated with high quality tags, but these resources were less likely highlighted by the link-structure method. We argue that to facilitate knowledge exploration in social tagging systems, it is important to keep a good balance between helping user to follow hot topics and to discover cold topics by including expertise rankings generated by both link and semantic structures.</p>

<div id="fu3" class="switchgroup3"><p>We present an extension of a computational cognitive model of social tagging and exploratory search called the semantic imitation model. The model assumes a probabilistic representation of semantics for both internal and external knowledge, and utilizes social tags as navigational cues during exploratory search. We used the model to generate a measure of information scent that controls exploratory search behavior, and simulated the effects of multiple presentations of navigational cues on both simple information retrieval and exploratory search performance based on a previous model called SNIF-ACT. We found that search performance can be significantly improved by these model-based presentations of navigational cues for both experts and novices. The result suggested that exploratory search performance depends critically on the match between internal knowledge (domain expertise) and external knowledge structures (folksonomies). Results have significant implications on how social information systems should be designed to facilitate knowledge exchange among users with different background knowledge.

We present results from an experiment that studied the information search behavior of younger and older adults in a medical decision-making task. To study how different combination of tasks and interfaces influenced search strategies and decision-making outcomes, we varied information structures of two interfaces and presented different task descriptions to participants. We found that younger adults tended to use different search strategies in different combination of tasks and interfaces, and older adults tended to use the same top-down strategies across conditions. We concluded that older adults were able to perform mental transformation of medical terms more effectively than younger adults. Thus older adults did not require changing strategies to maintain the same level of performance.</p>

Our study examined how experts and novices performed exploratory search using a traditional search engine and a social tagging system. As expected, results showed that social tagging systems could facilitate exploratory search for both experts and novices. We, however, also found that experts were better at interpreting the social tags and generating search keywords, which made them better at finding information when they were using the two interfaces. Specifically, experts found more general information than novices by better interpretation of social tags; and experts found more domain-specific information than novices by generating better keywords when using the search engine. We found a dynamic interaction between knowledge-in-the-head and knowledge-in-the-social-web, and demonstrated that although information seekers are becoming more and more reliant on information from the social Web, domain expertise is still important in guiding them to find information and evaluate the relevance of information. Implications on the design of social search systems that facilitate exploratory search are discussed.</p>

Do people from different cultures tag digital images differently? The current study compared the content of tags for digital images created by two cultural groups: European Americans and Chinese. In line with previous findings on cultural differences in attentional patterns, we found similar cultural differences in the order of the image parts (e.g., foreground or background objects) that people tag. We found that for European Americans, the first tag was more likely assigned to the main objects than that by Chinese; but for Chinese, the first tag was more likely assigned to the overall description or relations between objects in the images. The findings had significant implications for designing cultural-sensitive tools to facilitate the tagging and search process of digital media, as well as for developing data-mining tools that identify user profiles based on their tagging patterns and cultural origins.</p>

We studied when and how people will use a customization tool that helps users offload information indexing to the external environment to augment finding and re-finding of information in a computer desktop environment. An experiment was conducted to study how the cost and benefit of customization may influence when and how participants customize, and how the customization may help them find and re-find information. Results showed that participants were sensitive to the cost and benefit of customization. In general, participants performed more customization when the cost was low and when the benefit was high. Customization was also found to influence their information indexing strategy. Implications to design of customization tools for information indexing were discussed.</p>

Medication adherence is an essential activity for successful self-care, particularly for older adults who take multiple medications. Adherence depends on understanding how to take medication, which in turn depends on effective communication with providers. Unfortunately, physician and patient communication is often substandard and ineffective. Furthermore, successful adherence is often tied to supporting the patient's prospective memory by integrating medication taking with a daily routine. We have developed a paper-based tool (MedTable) for supporting provider-patient collaborative planning about taking medication, which has improved performance in a simulated medication scheduling task. The tool is used as an external workspace that reduces cognitive demands while also facilitating collaboration in a planning task. In the current study, the MedTable was redesigned and an electronic version was also developed. Both tools were compared to a less structured paper tool similar to medication reconciliation cards used in many health care settings (Medcard). 144 community dwelling older adults (aged 60 and over) participated in pairs in a simulated patient-provider medication scheduling task. Each pair solved four medication scheduling problems (2 simple and 2 complex) using one of the three tools (MedTable, e-MedTable, Medcard). Although all three tools supported highly accurate solutions, the MedTable produced significantly more accurate schedules than the Medcard (there were no tool differences in solution time). Moreover, participants rated workload associated with problem solving as lower for the two structured tools compared to the Medcard. The MedTable was also rated more usable than the non-structured aid. Finally, there was no evidence that older adults had difficulty using the computer-based tool, which suggests that a computer-based tool could be an effective intervention for improving provider-patient collaboration.</p>

<div id="fu9" class="switchgroup3"><p>
We describe a semantic imitation model of social tagging that integrates formal representations of semantics and a stochastic tag choice process to explain and predict emergent behavioral patterns. The model adopts a probabilistic topic model to separately represent external word-topic and internal word-concept relations. These representations are coupled with a tag-based topic inference process that predicts how existing tags may influence the semantic interpretation of a document. The inferred topics influence the choice of tags assigned to a document through a random utility model of tag choices. We show that the model is successful in explaining the stability in tag proportions across time and power-law frequency-rank distributions of tag co-occurrences for semantically general and narrow tags. The model also generates novel predictions on how emergent behavioral patterns may change when users with different domain expertise interact with a social tagging system. The model demonstrates the weaknesses of single-level analyses and highlights the importance of adopting a multi-level modeling approach to explain online social behavior.</p>

Previous research has shown that older adults performed worse in web search tasks, and attributed poorer performance to a decline in their cognitive abilities. We conducted a study involving younger and older adults to compare their web search behavior and performance in illdefined and well-defined information tasks using a health information website. In ill-defined tasks, only a general description about information needs was given, while in well-defined tasks, information needs as well as the specific target information were given. We found that older adults performed worse than younger adults in well-defined tasks, but the reverse was true in ill-defined tasks. Older adults compensated for their lower cognitive abilities by adopting a top-down knowledge-driven strategy to achieve the same level of performance in the ill-defined tasks. Indeed, path analysis showed that cognitive abilities, health literacy, and knowledge influenced search strategies adopted by older and younger adults. Design implications are also discussed.</p>

We studied the dynamic effects of information needs and social influence of tags in an exploratory search task. Although initially differences in information needs led to diversity in tag choices, this diversity disappeared as participants collaboratively tagged the same set of resources. Our findings are in general consistent with the notion that people conform to the collective interpretation of contents in an information system. In addition, our results showed that conformity does not only arise out of imitation of behavior, but also from the same underlying semantic interpretation or knowledge structures of users as they engage in informal collaboration through the social tagging system. Implications for design of social information system are discussed.</p>

This article presents a rational model developed under the distributed cognition framework that explains how social tags influence knowledge acquisition and adaptation in exploratory ill-defined information tasks. The model provides integrated predictions on the interactions among link selections, use and creation of tags, and the formation of mental categories. The model shows that the quality of tags not only influences search efficiency, but also the quality of mental categories formed during exploratory search. In addition, the model shows that aggregate regularities can be explained by microstructures of behavior that emerged from the adaptive assimilation of concepts and categories of multiple users through the social tagging system. The model has important implications on how collaborative systems could influence higher-level cognitive activities.</p>

Models of visual attention allocation suggest that monitoring is driven primarily by proximal cues like bandwidth and value. However, these cues might not always be predictive of the meaningful events an operator is asked to monitor. The aim of the current study is to extend visual sampling models by studying whether sampling can be influenced by more distal cues, like detecting patterns in the monitored signal, when proximal cues, like bandwidth, are not predictive of the meaningful events the operator is asked to monitor. Ten participants completed a task based on Senders’ (1964) experiment where operators were asked to monitor a series of four gauges to detect when the gauges traveled into the alarm region. The performance results suggest that participants could successfully adapt to the temporal sequence. However, participants did not show explicit awareness of the sequence, indicating that this type of learning could, in some cases, be implicit. Implications for display design and training are discussed.</p>

This paper presents a predictive model of a simple, but important, data entry task. The task requires participants to perceive and encode information on the screen, locate the corresponding keys for the information on different layouts of the keyboard, and enter the information. Since data entry is a central component in most human-machine interaction, a predictive model of performance will provide useful information that informs interface design and effectiveness of training. We created a cognitive model of the data entry task based on the ACT-R 5.0 architecture. The same model provided good fits to three existing data sets, which demonstrated the effects of fatigue with prolonged work, repetition priming, depth of processing, and the suppression of subvocal rehearsal. The model also makes predictions on how performance deteriorates with different delays after training, how different amounts of rehearsal during training affect retention, and how re-training helps retention of skills.using either the keypad on the right-hand side of the computer keyboard or the number row on the top of the keyboard. In some cases, they respond instead by typing the initial letters of each word (e.g., f e t s). Typically, no feedback concerning the accuracy of the responses is provided to the subjects, and they do not see their typed responses. There are three major component-processing stages in the data-entry task: encoding, response preparation, and response execution. Encoding involves perceptual processes, response preparation involves the mental construction of a motor program for entering the sequence, and response execution involves the actual motoric button presses.</p>
