<p><b>Our current research interests include the following categories:</b></p>
<div class="research-block">
<img src="../images/Education.png">
<p class="h1">Education</p>
<p>We are interested in educational technologies that help students learn better. In particular, we are interested in the potential of using digital games, embodied interactions, virtual and augmented reality, and other interaction techniques to enhance learning for younger (elementary and middle school) and older (high school and undergraduate) students.

<div class="research-block">
<img src="../images/Innovation.jpg">
<p class="h1">Community-led Innovation</p>
<p>Promising new ideas and practices often struggle to scale up and spread beyond small niches. Social and crowd-based platforms have the potential to bootstrap community-led innovations, but there is a lack of science to guide the design of these platforms to make them more effective. Our interests span from basic science to applied technologies, focusing on developing and evaluating theories and intelligent features that make community-led innovations more likely to succeed.

<div class="research-block">
<img src="../images/Healthcare.png">
<p class="h1">Healthcare</p>
<p>We are interested in developing and evaluating innovative technologies that improve the effectiveness of healthcare practices of professionals as well as to provide access to better services and health information for patients and the general public. Our research focuses on search and consumption of online health information, digital health interventions, and decision and communication support for physicians.</p>
</div>

<div class="research-block">
<img src="../images/Society.png">
<p class="h1">Society</p>
<p>Everyday we encounter controversies and choices, from political participation to product purchasing. By leveraging viewpoints abound, we can develop technologies and interfaces that promote critical thinking, unbiased education, and civil discourse.</p>

<p class="h1">Remote spatial reasoning under uncertainty</p>
<p><img src="../images/spatial.jpg" alt="spatial" width="306" height="240" align="right">How do people communicate spatial information through mobile devices? How can maps and interactions on mobile devices be designed to facilitate spatial inferences and reasoning under uncertainty? How do people utilize spatial cues and landmarks to make spatial inferences? How are spatial cues for indoor and outdoor navigation different? This project aims at understanding and supporting spatial reasoning under uncertainty when spatial knowledge may be distributed across people in remote locations.</p>

<p class="h1">From distributed cognition to collective intelligence</p>
<p>
<img src="../images/dCog.jpg" alt="dCOG" width="216" height="185" align="right">Can a large group of people (the crowd) be more intelligent than the best individual in the group? How can we derive intelligence from the crowd to solve problems, make decisions, foster innovation, and predict the future? What is the role of technologies in collective intelligence? The project aims at understanding how intelligence emerges from distributed cognition. Empirical methods and computational models are used to understand how individual cognitive agents may lead to collective behavioral patterns in various social environments.</p>

<p><img src="../images/search.jpg" alt="search " width="153" height="168" align="right">Search has always been a crucial process for intelligence. In fact, since the beginning of AI, search has always been a central theme of research. Cognitive search concerns how humans perform search that allows them to achieve higher level goals such as learning, decision making, or problem solving. This project aims at understanding the nature of cognitive search and how it differs from algorithmic search by machines.</p>
